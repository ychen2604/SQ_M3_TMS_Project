/// 
/// \class BuyerTasks
///
/// \brief The purpose of this class is to model BuyerTasks. The buyer represents an employee of OSHT who is tasked with requesting Customer contracts from the 
/// Contract Marketplace and generating an initial Order or contract. Their chief output is an Order, which 
/// is marked for action by the Planner. After the Plannerâ€™s work is completed, the Buyer confirms each 
/// completed Order and generates an Invoice to the Customer.
/// 1. Initiates contact with the Contract Marketplace to receive contracts from Customers
/// 2. Buyer may review existing Customers and accept new Customers (from the Marketplace)
/// into the TMS system
/// 3. Buyer may initiate a new Order from the Marketplace requests
/// 4. Buyer may select relevant Cities for the Order. This will nominate Carriers in those Cities 
/// for Order completion (which is confirmed by the Planner)
/// 5. Buyer may review completed Orders and process them for Invoice Generation.
/// 6. Invoice Generation results in a text file being generated with appropriate billing details. 
/// This information is also stored in the TMS database.
///
/// Data Members: N/A
